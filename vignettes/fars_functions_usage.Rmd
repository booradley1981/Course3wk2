This is documentation the package Course3wk2 for using functions to analyze Fatality Analysis Reporting System [fars] data.  This package was created for the Building R Packages Coursera Course.   

The package reads in data from files for specified years.  You can get either a summary of counts or a graphic map of accident locations.

Use fars_summarize_years(year(s)) to get a count summary

Use fars_map_state(state#,year) to get a map of accident locations
